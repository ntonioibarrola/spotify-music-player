<br /> <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<br />

<br /> <!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

There are two ways to access this project, **Full** and **Preview**.

With the **Full** method, you will have access to all the features available in this project. You will be able to view playlists from your own Spotify account, and you will be able to play songs for the entirety of its duration. Most of the features provided by Spotify API are available only to existing users of Spotify. **As a result, this method requires Spotify Premium.**

With the **Preview** method, you will have limited access to the project and Spotify's API. You will only have access to one playlist (one of my own), and you will only be able to play a 30-second preview of every song. A Spotify Premium account is not required. **This method is for users who simply want to get a rough idea of the features of this project without having to do any setup.**

### Full

#### 1. Register an application with Spotify

* Go to the [Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) page at the Spotify Developer website and login using your Spotify account.
* Once logged in, create a new app by clicking on "Create an App". Fill in the prompt however you like and click "Create".
* Click on "Edit Settings", and add the url, [http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify](http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify/), to the "Redirect URIs" section. Click "Save" to save your changes.
* Take note of the Client ID and the Client Secret.

#### 2. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ntonioibarrola/spotify-music-player.git
cd spotify-music-player
```
#### 3. Replace the code in .env.example with the given code, and rename the file to .env

```sh
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=123

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=       # Replace with Client ID provided in step 1
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=   # Replace with Client Secret provided in step 1

# Should look similar to this:
# SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=55520ed37c70a8174d29cb9390d08d30
# SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=55520ed37c70a8174d29cb9390d08d30
```

#### 4. Install dependencies and run locally

```sh
npm install
npm run dev   # Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

#### 5. Login using your Spotify account

* Go to the url, http://localhost:3000, in your browser.
* Click on "Login with Spotify" and login using your Spotify account.
* You should now have access to my app!
